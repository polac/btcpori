# Bitcoin Interest Group Landing Page

This project serves as a landing page for a local Bitcoin interest group. What makes this project unique is that it has been entirely developed and managed using AI - from code generation to project management. This serves as an experimental showcase of current AI capabilities in software development.

## ü§ñ AI-Driven Development

This entire project has been purposefully developed 100% by AI, including:
- Code generation
- Project structure
- Development decisions
- Project management
- Documentation

This approach allows us to explore and demonstrate the current capabilities and limitations of AI in software development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Local Development

#### Setting up Poetry Environment

1. First, install Poetry if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
   ```

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/polac/btcpori.git
   cd btcpori
   ```

3. Create and activate the Poetry environment:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   poetry shell
   ```

#### Running the Development Server

Once your environment is set up:

1. Make sure you're in the project directory with an activated environment
2. Run the local server:
   ```bash
   python local_server.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`

The server will start and host the website locally for development purposes.
