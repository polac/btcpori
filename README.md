# Bitcoin Interest Group Landing Page

This project serves as a landing page for a local Bitcoin interest group. What makes this project unique is that it has been entirely developed and managed using AI - from code generation to project management. This serves as an experimental showcase of current AI capabilities in software development.

## 🤖 AI-Driven Development

This entire project has been purposefully developed 100% by AI, including:
- Code generation
- Project structure
- Development decisions
- Project management
- Documentation

This approach allows us to explore and demonstrate the current capabilities and limitations of AI in software development.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Local Development

To run the development server:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Run the local server:
   ```bash
   python local_server.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`

The server will start and host the website locally for development purposes.
